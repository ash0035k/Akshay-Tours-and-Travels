<p><b><div>Founded in 1988 by Mr. Nandkumar Desai with just one car and an unwavering drive to succeed, Akshay Tours and Travels began its journey by overcoming challenges through dedication and exceptional service. From humble beginnings, the company quickly earned the trust of leading national and multinational clients, thanks to its strong focus on punctuality, safety, and customer support.

What started as a small car rental service evolved rapidly. In 1995, Akshay Tours and Travels introduced AC buses for Pune-Mumbai and airport transfers, pioneering residence pick-up and drop services with hourly departures—a model successfully replicated in Nashik in 2006.

The company expanded further into air ticketing, holiday tours, hotel bookings, and visa assistance by 2006, and launched hourly shared cabs for airport transfers in 2007 to meet growing demand.

Over the years, our commitment to quality and innovation has earned us prestigious accolades:

2012: Vocational Excellence Award by Rotary Club

2016: ISO 9001:2015 Certification & recognition by Ministry of Tourism as a Tourist Transport Operator

2019: Sakal Excellence Award in the Service Industry

2020: MAHABIZZ Business Excellence Award, Dubai

2023: Times Media Group’s Most Trusted Travel Agency

2024: Pune Times Mirror’s Iconic Punekar Award to Proprietor Mrs. Renuka Nandkumar Desai



Today, Akshay Tours and Travels operates 150+ self-owned cabs and offices in Pune, Mumbai, and Nashik, running 24/7 to deliver seamless service. Our motto, “Miles of Smiles,” reflects our promise to make every journey exceptional.
